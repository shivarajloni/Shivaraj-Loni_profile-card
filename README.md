## need to add social links
## changes required!!


### Problem: 
My uncle runs a small business and has many visiting card which has basic information the business and other contact details printed already, but due to corona out-break and due to social distancing no one was ready to accept the visiting card or any kind of physical items. So, I came to know about this situation.  

### Solution: 
To solve this problem were the customers can get he basic details of the business and contact details, i understood the problem and was searching for some ideas to work on it. Then, I got an idea to develop a basic website/app which could solve the problem which is faced by many other businesses too in the surroundings.
I developed a business/personal Digital visiting card, which portraits the basic information about the business and basic contact details with all other social-handles on the digital visiting card, which is interact-able and easily accessible to everyone without any physical interaction thereby avoid the corona spread.
Tech-stack used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, Mysql.
